Included Files
  •	CodeBook.rmd is a codebook created with R Markdown (RMD) using Knit. It describes the variables, data, and any transformations or work that I performed for clean up.
  •	run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and 5-steps for generating a Tidy data file, as described in the course project’s definition: 
    o	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    o	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    o	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    o	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    o	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  •	FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
